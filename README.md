# Lunch learning session 04/07/2024

This repo is created for a short learning session about new features in dotnet 7 and 8. Focus is on language features and ASP.NET features. There are some features left out because of time contraints.

This repository uses the [Polyglot Notebooks extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.dotnet-interactive-vscode) for VS Code. Install it to view the resources in the intended way and run any code examples.
